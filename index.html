    <h1>Elliot's CodeFellows SEA-B30 game!</h1>
    <h2>Greetings!</h2>
    <p>Hello and welcome to this lovely little web page! I'm glad you've stopped by to test your knowledge of your classmates! In today's scripting, we'll be testing how well you can guess the middle names of your fellow students!</p>

    <p>In this handy dandy little site, you'll be asked to pick a co-educatee's first name and then guess their middle name! You'll have unlimited guesses and a hint for each along the way to help out! Don't worry if you don't guess correctly, this whole thing is only for my grade and in no way, shape, or form reflects on you as a human being and will NOT mean I fail at life and then lose my house and thus have to pimp out pettings of my kitty for a living. Really, it's not that big of a deal!

<h2>Get ready to play a game!</h2>
  </p>In the section below, you will enter your first, middle, and last name, as well as a hint regarding your middle name. These will be saved and added to the list of others that have played this game already, and thus your fellow students will get to guess about you! If you have played this game, or otherwise don't care to add yourself to the document, you can skip ahead by making sure the the checkbox below is checked.
  <hr/><ul>To do:<li>directions here?</li><li>check box checked disables inputs</li>

  <h4>This is completely unrelated to the program</h4>
    <p>Now, because I'm bored and I have nothing else to put into this space, I'm going to use some of the common tags used in HTML! For example, wrapping a word in a tag with a b makes it look <b>bold</b>. Or you can use the i key for <i>italics</i>. Additionally, the <strong>strong</strong> and <em>em (emphasis)</em> might LOOK like they're <b>bold</b> or <i>italicized</i>, but they really aren't!</p>
    <p>In this paragraph, I'm going to blatanty plagiarize one of my text books to show two more tags! I won't tell you which book, or that would defeat the purpose of plagiarism! That said, do you know what <acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</acronym> stands for? <acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration! Turns out, if you hover your cursor over <acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA, the full name will show. Hey!! Let's make that part of the guessing game!
    <p>Here's another good trick, we can use HTML to NEST one function inside another! Like this:
    <blockquote><acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration"><b><i>NASA</i></b></blockquote>Now, normally block quotes are only used for long, long quotations, but I'm using this as an example.</p>
    <p>To finalize, I'm going to put a bunch of links in a list because, well... I can!
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com/</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/">this is another link to google</li></a>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">opens google in a new page</li></a>
        <li><a href="#top">got a small window? Go to the top!</li></a>
      </ul>
